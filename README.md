# CCBill SDK for Ruby

Unofficial CCBill SDK for Ruby.

This gem provides:
- Easy Install
- Getting started guide
- Generator that creates
  - Approve/Deny callback paths
  - Background Post path
- Url/Form Generator for test and live mode


> Important! CCBill provides two types of payment forms. FlexForms is our newest (and recommended) system. In this gem we use ONLY FlexForms.


# Getting started

```ruby
gem 'ccbill_ruby'
```

Then run `bundle install`

Next, you need to run the generator:

```console
$ rails generate ccbill:install
```

This will create a controller (if one does not exist) and configure it with the default actions. The generator also configures your config/routes.rb file to point to the CCBill controller.


## Example of usage:

```ruby
form = Ccbill::DynamicPricing.new({
  initial_price_in_cents: 355
  initial_period: 30,
  order_id: 'Any configuration information'
})

form.valid?    #=> True/False
form.url       #=> URL
```


## Controller and methods:

Before reading this part - please read [Setup guide](#setup-guide)

`rails generate ccbill:install` will generate next:

```ruby
  # config/routes.rb
  namespace :callbacks do
    resource :ccbill, only: [:show, :create]
  end
```

```ruby
  # config/initializers/ccbill.rb
  CCBill.configure do |config|
    config.mode = :test
    config.salt = 'Encryption Key'
    config.default_currency = '840' # USD
    config.account = 'account_id'
    config.sub_account = '0000'
    config.flexform_id = 'flexform_id'
  end
```

```ruby
  # app/controllers/callbacks/ccbills_controller.rb
  module Callbacks
    class CcbillsController < ApplicationController
      # before_action :check_ccbill_callback, only: :create

      # GET: Redirect from payment system after approval/deny.
      def show
        case response_params[:mppResponse]
        when 'CheckoutSuccess'
          flash[:notice] = "Payment was successfully paid"
        when 'CheckoutFail'
          flash[:alert] = "Payment was declined. We're sorry"
        else
          fail 'Unknown mmpResponse'
        end

        redirect_to root_url
      end

      # POST: Post Back
      def create
        postback = CCBill::Postback.new(response_params)

        if postback.approval?
          # Do something "Approval" postback.
        else
          # Do something "Deny" postback.
        end

        head :no_content
      end

      private

      def response_params
        @response_params ||= params.except(:controller, :action).to_unsafe_h
      end
    end
  end
```

# Payment Flow

To make some payment through CCBill via DynamiPricing:

The payment form is the CCBill form that will be displayed to customers after they choose to check out using CCBill. The payment form accepts customer payment information, processes the payment, and returns the customer to your Site through callbacks ( GET ) where you can catche the response and do proper redirect:

### Step 1:

1. You should generate LINK that contains information about order/subscription

This gem will help you in this, next script will generate link:
```ruby
Ccbill::DynamicPricing.new({
  initial_price_in_cents: 355
  initial_period: 30,
  order_id: 'Any configuration information'
}).url
```

This link contains variables: `initial_price`, `initial_period` and additional variable `order_id`.  To enhance security, that url contains `FormDigest` value. The formDigest value is a hex-encoded MD5 hash, calculated using a combination of the fields and a salt value. [More information](https://kb.ccbill.com/Dynamic+Pricing+User+Guide#Generating_the_MD5_Hash)


### Step 2:

2. By clicking on this link user will be redirected to the CCBill payment form.
This form is generated by admin. Find out more at [Configure your CCBill Account:](#configure-your-ccbill-account) section.

When user fill-in all fields. He can follow 2 way: `Approve` and `Deny`

But here is two thing:
1 On `Deny` response: App will propose to Try Again (User will stay at the payment system)
2 On `Deny` response: App will receive `Deny` postback. ( `callbacks/ccbills#create` ). With Deny attributes.
3 To Receive `Deny` redirect:
> The reason you aren’t redirected to denial URL is because our system sees these declines as ‘soft’ declines, and by default, you need to have at least 3 soft declines in a row until you are redirected to denial url. So if you want to test denial redirection, you will need to click ‘Try again’ and fill out the credit card number for three consecutive times and you will be redirected. If the consumer is ‘hard’ declined(for example transaction is denied by consumer’s bank), he would be redirected after first form submission. Additionally, we can turn off this rule to have soft denial three times before redirection and if you would like us to do so, please confirm.
4. Test Cards
[Test cards](https://kb.ccbill.com/How+do+I+set+up+a+user+to+process+test+transactions) you can find here. But one thing you should remember: Only `CVV` metters:
>  When performing test transactions in Sandbox mode, cvv2 higher then 300 will result in approval even though you used denial credit card. If you try to test it in live mode, you would receive denial no matter what cvv2 you are using.

### Step 2:

`Approval Path` and `Deny Path` we set up [here](#create-an-approval-url)

**Approval Path**

This is the path customers take when their transaction is approved. The Approval Tile is always below the Primary and Deny Tile. When editing the Approval Path, your options are limited.

**Deny Path**

This is the path consumers take when they are declined on a transaction. They will be redirected to the deny path to try again. The Deny Tile is always to the right of the Primary Tile.

To set up a Deny Path:

- Click the Deny Tile. A new window has opened. It will be very similar to the one you saw when you created the Primary Tile.
- Select one of several redirect options along the left side of the screen.
  - New Form. Create a new FlexForm as you did for the Primary Tile.
  - Existing Form. Use a previously made Form.
  - URL. Add an external or internal link. Send customers back to your website or to a third party payment form.

![Deny Path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/redirect_path.png)


### Step 3:
After previouse steps, ccbill returns the customer to your Site through callbacks ( GET ) where you can catche the response and do proper redirect:

```ruby
  callbacks_ccbill GET    /callbacks/ccbill(.:format)  callbacks/ccbills#show
                   POST   /callbacks/ccbill(.:format)  callbacks/ccbills#create
```

### Step 4:

Postback: According to `POST` action in your controller.

Background Post allows Merchants to receive data posts from our system to a script that the Merchant creates. Merchants can parse that data from the script into their databases/tables for member tracking. Background Post only works for NEW transactions.

Some kind of background callback to the app that happens on each attempt to Pay

This callback contains a lot of information of the attempt: [Background Post](https://kb.ccbill.com/Background+Post)



# Setup guide

## Instructions:

In order to set up a CCBill payment method, a CCBill Merchant account needs to be created.

### Main Account

All CCBill clients have an account number for tracking purposes. The standard format is 9xxxxx-xxxx, where 6-digit number (9xxxxx) is the main account.

You can retrieve your main account number at the top bar near **Client Account** section.

Please enter the main account number to **Main Account** field.

### Sub Account
After sign up for a website billing, you will be able to create a subaccount.  The subaccount is a 4-digit number (xxxx) which is a part of main account.

To create a subaccount, go to **Account Info** menu item / **Sub Account Admin** section / **Create Subaccount**. After follow the instructions provided by CCBill to complete the subaccount.

### Secret Key

You may obtain Salt value in 2 different ways:

- Contact CCBill Client Support and receive Salt value.
- You may create your own Salt value and provide it to CCBill Client Support.

Please note that Salt value is an alphanumeric string up to 32 characters long.


### Form Secret Key ( flexform_id ):
In you CCBill Merchant Area you will be available to choose one of the CCBill Global Forms.

To retrieve one, go to **Flexform System** / **FlexForm Payment Links**. After click on **Forms Library**. Here will be displayed all forms that already in use (If you see nothing - that means you should create at least one `Payment Flow` )

After select an appropriate form you can customize it and preview it. ( How to customize form look into [FAQ](https://kb.ccbill.com/FlexForms+FAQs) of the CCBill )


### Callbacks URLs:

**Success** and **Failure** callback URLs need to be set up.

This urls you can setup at:
- click **Account Info**
- click **Sub Account Admin**
- select Any subaccount
- click **Advansed** section
- Set **Approval Post URL** and **Denial Post URL**

For local machine ( development env ) I use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) to set valid path.

> Important!
> You gotta be logged in to the CCBill admin to be able to see your forms in the sandbox.

## Configure your CCBill Account:

The following CCBill settings must be correct for the payment module to work correctly.

### Dynamic Pricing

Please work with your CCBill support representative to activate Dynamic Pricing for your account ( sub-account ). You can verify that Dynamic Pricing is active at **Account Info** > **Manage the subaccount menu** > **Pick 0000 subaccount from select menu** > **Feature Summary** at the bottom. in the Admin Portal. Your Dynamic Pricing status appears at the bottom of the **Billing Tools** section.

![Billing Tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/billing_tools.png)

Please note that if Dynamic Pricing is enabled on the subaccount level, ALL signup forms on that subaccount must use Dynamic Pricing in order to function correctly. This includes forms created on the subaccount prior to Dynamic Pricing being enabled. If Dynamic Pricing is enabled only on a particular form and not the entire subaccount, other forms on that subaccount will not be required to use Dynamic Pricing.

![URL Library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/url_library.png)

### Creating a Salt / Encryption Key

A "salt" is a string of random data used to make your encryption more secure. **Sub Account Admin** > **Advanced**. It will appear in the **Encryption Key** field of the **Upgrade Security Setup Information section**.

Make note of the Salt: this value will be entered into the your configuration file. ( `config/initializers/ccbill.rb` )

![ENCRYPTION KEY](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/encryption_key.png)

### Disabling User Management

Since this sub-account will be used for Dynamic Pricing transactions (not managing user subscriptions), User Management must be disabled.

- Sign in to the **Admin Portal**.
- On the **Account Info** megamenu, click **Sub Account Admin**, then **User Management** on the left menu.
- Select **Turn off User Management** in the top section.
- Select **Do Not Collect Usernames and Passwords** in the **Username Settings** section.

![Disabling User Management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/disabling_user_management.png)

### Creating a New FlexForms Payment Form
Here is standart [Getting Started with Flex Froms](https://kb.ccbill.com/FlexForms+Quick+Start+Guide).

#### Visit FlexForms:
- Ensure All is selected in the top Client Account drop-down menu. FlexForms are not specific to sub accounts, and cannot be managed when a sub account is selected.
- Navigate to the FlexForms Systems tab in the top menu bar and select FlexForms Payment Links. All existing forms will be displayed in a table.
- Make sure that you in sendbox ( Top left corner )

#### Create an Approval URL

- Click the **URLs Library** button in the upper-right to create a new URL. The Saved URLs Editor dialog displays.
- Create Payment Success URL
  - Use the fields under **Add New** to create a new URL with the following properties.
  - URL Name. Enter a meaningful name for this URL. Forexample: **Payment Success**
  - URL. Under URL, enter the base URL for your Site store. Forexample: `http://[SiteHost or Ngrok]/callbacks/ccbill?mppResponse=CheckoutSuccess`
- Create Payment Decline URL. Forexample: `http://[SiteHost or Ngrok]/callbacks/ccbill?mppResponse=CheckoutFail`
- Click Save to commit your changes.

> Important:
> 1. Do not create alot of flex-form. You can't delete them!
> 2. This is URLS ( GET ) where user will be redirected after success/deny payment.
> 3. We set `mppResponse=CheckoutSuccess` and `mppResponse=CheckoutFail` because we use this attribute at `callbacks/ccbills#show` action.

![URLs Editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/url_editor.png)

#### Create a New FlexForm

- Click the `Add New** button in the upper-left to create a new form.
- The **A New Form** dialog is displayed:
  - **Payment Flow Name**. At the top, enter a name for the new payment flow (this will be different than the form name, as a single form can be used in multiple flows). Forexample: 'Dev Form'
  - **Form Name**. Under Form Name, enter a name for the form. Forexample: '001ff'
  - **Dynamic Pricing**. Under Pricing, check the box to enable dynamic pricing.
  - **Layout**. Select your desired layout
  - Save the form
- Edit the Flow
  - Approval redirect to the Site
    - Click the arrow button to the left of your new flow to view the details. ( Screenshot below )
    - Under the green Approve arrow, click the square to modify the action.
    - **Approval URL**. In the left menu, select A URL. Select **Select a Saved URL** and select the URL your created earlier (e.g. Payment Success).
    - **Redirect Time**. Select a redirect time of 1 second using the slider at the bottom and save the form. ( e.g. 4 seconds )
  - Deny redirect to the Site
    - Under the red Deny arrow, click the square to modify the action.
    - **Approval URL. In the left menu, select A URL. Select **Select a Saved URL** and select the URL your created earlier (e.g. Payment Decline`).
    - **Redirect Time**. Select a redirect time of 1 second using the slider at the bottom and save the form. ( e.g. 7 seconds )
- Flex ID. Make note of the Flex ID: this value will be entered into the your configuration file. ( `config/initializers/ccbill.rb` )


#### Background Post

While still in the **Sub Account Admin** section, select **Advanced** from the left menu. Notice the top section titled **Background Post Information**. We will be modifying the **Approval Post URL** and **Denial Post URL** fields.

Path | URL
--- | ---
**Approval Post URL** | `http://[SiteHost or Ngrok]/callbacks/ccbill`
**Denial Post URL** | `http://[SiteHost or Ngrok]/callbacks/ccbill`

CCBill calls this URL in background.

Note: That will be `POST` request. In our case It will call `callbacks/ccbills#create` action. In this action based on patams we will find-out what request was called.

![Background Post Information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DmytroVasin/ccbill_ruby/master/images/background_post_information.png)

**Your CCBill account is now configured**
